# Quick start guide to use this repository in your computer:

This project contains a node/gulp package with SCSS, a system of HTML templates and a web server. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to work with this repository, then follow the steps below.

>#### If you don't have the gulp command, you must install it in all the computer so as to use it in all folders, by using `npm install --global gulp-cli`

1. Clone the repository from GitHub in your computer. Copy the repo link and paste it in your terminal after the command *git clone*, then press enter.

2. Write `$ npm install` and press enter, in order to activate the **Gulp tasks** that are included in the project. (**npm install** to install the necessary packages to convert SASS to CSS, minify, etc). Also you start the repo with `$ gulp`
Note: We have incorporated the gulp package from Adalab: [Adalab web starter kit](https://github.com/Adalab/Adalab-web-starter-kit).

3. After these steps, your cloned repository is ready to use! And please don’t forget to make a “pull request” of your branch with modifications. Thanks ;)

> ### While we are working with our code: From our term we use command `gulp` to activate its task by default, that in the case of `gulpfile.js` that we have in this project it would be pending of our folders of Sass, html and JavaScript and it will compile them, minify them and/or refresh the browser each time we make a change.

# Gulp tasks included:

## Start of a web server for development
```
$ gulp
```
Initiates a web server with BrowserSync and a few watchers will be alert of SCSS/JS/HTML files, in the folder **public/**, to refresh the browser when necessary.

## Version ready to upload to production
```
$ gulp docs
```
Inside the docs/ folder generates CSS and JS minified and without sourcecamps ready to upload to the repository and activate GitHub Pages in `master/docs`.

## Structure of the gulp tasks package
Gulpfile.js uses a JSON with configuration os the paths files to generate/watch.
The structure of the folders looks like this:
```
/
`- _src
   |- assets
   |  |- images
   |  |- js
   |  `- scss
   |     `- core
   |
   `- templates
      `- partials

```

## HTML
Is included the package [**gulp-html-partial**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-html-partial) that allows us to have a html templates system.

## CSS
Is included the package [**gulp-combine-mq**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-combine-mq) groups all media queries at the end of the CSS document.

## JS
The JSON with configuration specifies the JS files we use and the order they must process theirselves.
